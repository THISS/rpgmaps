# RPG Maps

Application for spontaneously creating encounter maps for tabletop role-playing games.

## Demo

Demonstration available at:

<https://rpgmaps.herokuapp.com/>

You will be redirected to a page with a unique ID where you can edit a map. When you click "Update Players", anyone who
is viewing the site at the same URL minus the `/edit` at the end will see the new map you created.

## Suggestions

Try filling the canvas with one texture and carving out paths for the players. For example, fill it with solid stone and
carve out tunnels with stone ground. Or fill it with still water and carve out islands using smooth paths.
